    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.
     And after your set your API key in the google_maps_key string resource below than rename this file to:
     google_maps_api.xml
     You also need to set the API Key in the same file in the release folder. Change to "project view" to see the
     release folder.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=YOUR_SHA-1_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE_HERE%3Bdev.jesselima.locateme

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    dev.jesselima.locateme

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    OUR_SHA-1_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE_HERE

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
